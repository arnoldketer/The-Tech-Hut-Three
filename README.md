The Tech Hut Three

## Project Description
Given number of strengths, I'm looking to identify the two closest strengths and show their difference with an integer (â‰¥ 0).

Here I'm using two functions;
* LargestNumber() - Gets the largest number in a given list.
* SecondLargest() - Gets the second largest number in a given list.
The main() Function then calls both functions on a given list and calculates the difference between them.

### Getting started
1. Open VS Code: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. Open Your Python Script: Open the Python script FirstMaximum.py .You can do this by going to File > Open File to open the specific script.

3. Select Python Interpreter:

    You can choose the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom status bar 
    To create or modify settings, you can go to File > Preferences > Settings, then search for "Python Path" and set it to the path of your Python interpreter.

4. Run Your Python Script:

    Right-click on the script in the file explorer and select "Run Python File in Terminal" or by opening a terminal in VS Code and running python FirstMaximum.py.


5. Output: You will see the output of your Python script in the terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code interface.
